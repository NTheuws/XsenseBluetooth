# XsenseBluetooth
Working version of the Xsens DOT bluetooth example

Project made using android studios and the example code given by Xsens for development using their DOT accelerometer.
Updated the imports,
readded the references,
added permission for the app to use bluetooth on the phone.

When using this project:
- Clean the code to prevent older errors from other projects to stay around.
- Build the project.
- Don't use the android studios simulator when testing bluetooth connection.
- Set your phone in development mode and connect it to android studios.
- Use your phone to launch the app instead of the simulator.

When launching the app make sure to allow bluetooth connections else you have to go into the app settings within your phone to allow this.
you can press scan to find bluetooth devices, make sure that bluetooth is on for both your phone and the dot.
If a DOT shows up you can connect to it by tapping the text.
After connecting itll show the battery life and the name.
You can find the live values from the Dot after pressing the dots in the top right and selecting the live values.
